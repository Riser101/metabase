(ns metabase.driver.bigquery
  "Google BigQuery driver. For the most part piggybacks off of the Generic SQL driver, but as BigQuery is not
  JDBC-based significant parts such as syncing and executing queries are customized.

  Since this is a rather complicated driver, it is broken out into two namespaces. The other namespace,
  `metabase.driver.bigquery.client`, serves as a wrapper around the BigQuery API itself, and also handles conversions
  between types returned by BigQuery queries and those expected by Metabase itself. Functions related to sync metadata
  fetching, running queries, and post-processing their results can be found there.

  Note that there is no separate `query-processor` namespace; having one is certainly a more normal way to split a
  large driver, but splitting the driver in that way proved to be more confusing than the current separation.

  Keep in mind that in addition to using logic from the Generic SQL driver, the BigQuery driver also shares some logic
  with the Google Analytics driver. This shared code can be found in the `metabase.driver.google` namespace."
